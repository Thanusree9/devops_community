GitLab Login Procedure:
To access GitLab, head over to the official site at [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com). Look for the **Sign In** button at the top right of the page and click it. You’ll be taken to the login screen where you can enter your username or registered email, along with your password. If you’ve set up two-factor authentication, you’ll also need to enter the verification code from your authenticator app. GitLab also offers the option to log in through third-party services like Google or GitHub if your account is connected to them. Once your login details are confirmed, you’ll be directed to your GitLab dashboard where you can oversee your repositories, manage projects, and handle development tasks.
 Connecting GitHub with Visual Studio Code:
To connect GitHub with VS Code, begin by ensuring Git is installed on your computer and that you’ve set up a GitHub account. Open VS Code and install the **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** extension for seamless integration. Launch the terminal within VS Code and configure your Git credentials by running:
`git config --global user.name "YourName"`
`git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"`
After that, click on the Accounts icon at the bottom-left corner of VS Code and choose **Sign in to GitHub**. Once signed in, you’ll be able to clone repositories, push and pull changes, and manage branches directly within VS Code—making collaboration and version control much easier.
 Starting a New Project in GitLab:
Creating a project in GitLab is straightforward and ideal for tracking code and collaborating with your team. After logging in, click on the **New Project** button from your dashboard. You can start with an empty project, import an existing repository, or use a pre-designed template. Enter a project name, add a description if you like, and decide whether it will be **Public, Internal, or Private**. Hit **Create project**, and your repository will be ready to use. You can now begin adding files, writing code, opening issues, and leveraging GitLab’s CI/CD features to automate your build and deployment processes.
How to Create Issues in a GitLab Project:
Issues in GitLab help you manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests efficiently. To create one, open your project and go to the **Issues** tab. Click **New Issue**, then provide a clear title and a detailed description of the task or problem. You can assign the issue to a specific team member, add labels for categorization, set milestones, and even define a due date. Once you hit **Submit issue**, it will appear in your project’s issue tracker where your team can monitor updates, add comments, and move the issue through different stages until it’s resolved.
 YouTube API Overview:
The YouTube API, available via Google Developers, allows you to integrate YouTube’s features into your own applications. It lets you access content like videos, playlists, channels, comments, and search results. Developers can use it to upload videos, manage playlists, analyze channel data, and control playback functionalities. The API relies on HTTP requests and supports authentication using API keys or OAuth 2.0. Comprehensive documentation, sample requests, and response examples are provided on the Google Developers site to help developers quickly understand and use the API effectively, all while adhering to YouTube’s usage policies and quota restrictions.
 How to Embed a YouTube Video:
Embedding a YouTube video is a simple process. Start by opening the desired video on YouTube, click the **Share** button, and select **Embed**. You’ll be given an HTML `<iframe>` snippet that you can copy. Open any text or code editor, create a new file (e.g., `video.html`), and paste the embed code into it. Save the file and open it using a web browser to view the embedded video directly on your custom page.
